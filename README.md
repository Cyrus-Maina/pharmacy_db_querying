# pharmacy_db_querying
A pharmacy has tasked us with business problems solvable by querying their Database. We drew insights and provided recommendations for the business problems.

Within the SQL scripts are code used to query the database and recommendations drawn.

The CSV files contain results from the queries and an ER diagram is included in PNG format.
