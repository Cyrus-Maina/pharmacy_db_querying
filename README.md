# pharmacy_db_querying
A pharmacy has tasked us with business problems solvable by querying their Database. We drew insights and provided recommendations for the business problems.

Within the SQL scripts are code used to query the database and insights/recommendations made from the results.
We also explain why the business would need to solve such a problem.

The CSV files contain results from the queries and an ER diagram in PNG format.
